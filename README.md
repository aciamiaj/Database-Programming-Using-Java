# Database-Programming-Using-Java

Database Programming Using Java
This is a repository that contains Java programs created for database programming. The programs cover various concepts such as connecting to a database, querying data, and updating data.

Installation
To run the programs, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.

In addition, you will need to have a database management system (DBMS) installed on your machine. The programs in this repository were created using MySQL, but you can use any DBMS that is compatible with JDBC.

Usage
To use the programs, you will need to set up a database and create the necessary tables. You can use a GUI tool such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin to do this.

Once you have set up the database, you can run the Java programs by compiling the source code and then running the compiled program. You can do this using a command prompt or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Before running the programs, you will need to modify the connection string in the code to match your database configuration.

Credits
These programs were created by Jaimaica Daisy Eugenio as part of a course on database programming using Java.
